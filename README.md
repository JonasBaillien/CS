GLRT LCQBA.R: example generalized likelihood ratio test for central symmetry in a linear combination of QBA-distributions model
GLRT SNC.R: example of GLRT for central symmetry in skew-normal copula for fit with assumed marginal symmetry 
GLRT SPC: example of GLRT for central symmetry in skew-normal copula for fit without assumed marginal symmetry

Data Examples with tests.R: Tests for central symmetry on two datasets
Plots data examples.R: plots of results data examples; requires data examples with tests to have run as this generates the results
